# python-learning-journal
A repository to document my Python learning journey

About me:
I know python and a little bit of HTML. I have done small projects using Python in previous classes I've taken, however, I'm looking to learn more so I can create bigger projects. 

Goals for this course:
I want to improve my python programming skills so I can work on bigger projects and also just in general get better at coding.
